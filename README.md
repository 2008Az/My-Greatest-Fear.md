# ðŸŒŒ My Greatest Fear
"The only thing we have to fear is fear itself." - Franklin D. Roosevelt 
ðŸªž **Fear isnâ€™t just about whatâ€™s out there. Sometimes, fear is looking in the mirror and seeing the truth staring back.**

My Fear has worn many faces.

It begins quietly. Maybe with a step toward the edge of a tall cliff. My legs would shake just from the thought. The wind pulls at your clothes like invisible hands, and suddenly your heart races. I am afraid of **heights**, yes... but also of how *I* got here.  

##### *Why did I step this close?*

Sometimes I find myself in a space where I canâ€™t breathe. The room is filled with screams, shouting, music, and voices. I hate the **loudness**, hate how I canâ€™t do anything but think back and ask myself why Iâ€™m here. Because of this choice, I feel like I might just break down. All I can think about is my mistakes.  

##### *Why didnâ€™t I leave sooner?*

Night. A moon hangs in the sky, covered by soft blue clouds. It looks beautiful. Iâ€™m not scared of **night** itself, but of what happens in it. All the light shines on the moon, and everything else is swallowed by blackness. I hate when I wake up and suddenly I canâ€™t move. I feel like Iâ€™m falling, paralyzed, while something at the door just stands there watching me. The only thing keeping it at bay is me, staring back at it.  
I donâ€™t fear the night. I fear the **dark**. But more than that, I fear what my imagination can do with it.  

##### *Why do I always think the worst?*

Iâ€™ve dreamed of walking along the shore and feeling the waves more times than I can count. But somehow, what I dream of most is what I fear the most. The idea that the **ocean** is endless, and there are things out there in the deep unknown. The fear isnâ€™t just the sea. Itâ€™s that I always have to remind myself to think of the beach instead of what lies beneath. Itâ€™s the kind of darkness that feels just like the one in the night, where you canâ€™t see a thing.  

##### *Why didnâ€™t I stay where it was safe?*

### But my real fear would have to be myself.

Each fearâ€”heights, noise, darkness, water, the starsâ€”wears a different mask. But underneath them all is the same quiet truth:

##### I put myself in those situations.  
##### *I'm scared of the choices Iâ€™ve made, I make, and I will make.*

Most of the good things in my life came from my own choices. But so did the worst. Thatâ€™s what scares me the most. When I make a decision I regret, thereâ€™s no one else to blame. I have to live with it. I have to face myself.

Iâ€™m simply trying to live a good life, one with as few regrets as possible.  
But when I look back on my past, I know that something has to change.  
Maybe that something... is me.
